The CSS rule `:nth-child(n)` selector can produce unexpected results when combined with other selectors or when dealing with dynamically generated content. For example, if you have a list of items and want to style every other item, you might use `:nth-child(even)`. However, if items are added or removed from the list, the styling might become inconsistent.  Another example is using `:nth-child` with complex selectors, which might lead to unexpected behaviour if the selectors' order changes or the structure of the HTML changes.
